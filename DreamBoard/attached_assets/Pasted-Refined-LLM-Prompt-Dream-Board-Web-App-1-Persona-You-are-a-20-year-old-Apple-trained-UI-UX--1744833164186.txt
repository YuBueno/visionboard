Refined LLM Prompt — Dream Board Web App

⸻

1 · Persona

You are a 20‑year‑old Apple‑trained UI/UX engineer known for flawless micro‑interactions, first‑class accessibility, and pixel‑perfect, mobile‑first design—think Apple Vision Pro reveal levels of polish.

2 · Mission

Design Dream Board, an AI‑powered web app that lets people capture ambitions and turn them into structured, actionable road‑maps.
Deliver a complete product specification covering: information architecture, wireframe‑style layouts (ASCII or mermaid), component inventory (React + Tailwind naming), data models / API contracts (JSON schema), user‑flow diagrams, animation & motion guidelines, and accessibility notes (WCAG 2.2 AA or better).

3 · Core Requirements & Pages

Landing Page
	•	Full‑viewport cork‑board aesthetic.
	•	“Add Dream” mini‑form pinned at bottom‑center.
	•	Sticky‑note dreams pop onto the board via spring animation (Framer Motion).
	•	Top navigation: Pricing, Features, Our Team, Sign In, Sign Up.

Per‑Dream Navigation Paradigm
	•	Each dream is a clickable sticky note.
	•	Clicking a note opens a dedicated Dream Dashboard in a new route (/dream/:id).
	•	The dashboard and all sub‑pages (Timeline, Goals, Vision Gallery, Resources, Settings) are scoped exclusively to that dream; switching dreams swaps the entire sidebar context.

Authentication (Sign In / Sign Up)
	•	Single card with tab switcher.
	•	Fields: Email and Password (with strength meter).
	•	Magic‑link fallback; optional Apple/Google one‑tap.

Dream Dashboard (per dream)
	•	Left sidebar: Dashboard, Timeline, Goals, Vision Gallery, Resources, Settings.
	•	Header shows dream title and cover photo.
	•	AI Insights widget: progress %, next best action, confidence score.
	•	Data and state are isolated per dream—no cross‑contamination.

Goals & Timeline (per dream)
	•	AI seeds a draft timeline: granular Tasks grouped into Milestones.
	•	Items include title, description, status (To‑Do, Doing, Done), priority, due date.
	•	Drag‑and‑drop reorder; double‑click to edit.

Resources (per dream)
	•	Server‑side agent scrapes and ranks articles, videos, and tools relevant to the selected dream only.
	•	Filters: Type, Cost, Time‑to‑consume, Verified‑by‑AI.

Vision Gallery (per dream)
	•	Upload photos, videos, text snippets, quotes documenting the journey.
	•	Masonry grid with lightbox preview.

Settings (per dream)
	•	Rename dream, upload cover image, delete dream (with confirmation).
	•	Optional color‑palette picker to re‑skin that dream’s dashboard.

4 · Global Design Tenets
	1.	Delight in motion — subtle parallax, 120 ms ease‑out timing.
	2.	Instant feedback — optimistic UI; every user action reflects immediately.
	3.	Accessibility first — full keyboard nav, prefers‑reduced‑motion respect, aria‑labels.
	4.	Brand voice — optimistic, encouraging, future‑focused (“Your dream is 12 % closer!”).

5 · Technical Constraints
	•	Stack: React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Supabase Auth, Postgres, LangChain‑powered serverless functions.
	•	Performance: first meaningful paint < 1.8 s on 3G; Lighthouse ≥ 95.
	•	Security: JWT auth, HTTPS everywhere, OWASP Top 10 mitigations.

6 · AI Responsibilities
	•	Generate initial timeline from dream description.
	•	Re‑score progress daily using task completion.
	•	Recommend next actions and learning resources with cited links.
	•	Summarize community‑shared tips (future social layer).

7 · Deliverable Format

Return one Markdown document with clearly labeled sections in the order above.
Use code blocks for JSON schemas, mermaid diagrams, and React component trees.
Do not include actual front‑end code; focus on specification and structure.
